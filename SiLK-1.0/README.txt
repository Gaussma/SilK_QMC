                      An LA-SiGMA Software Distribution
                                SiLK package
                             Version 1.0 - Jul 2015

The Sign Learning Kink (SiLK) based Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method is based
on Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, and can reduce the
minus sign problem when calculating energies in atomic and molecular systems.

The code requires as input the one and two electron integrals, which usually
are computed using the NWChem package. Example input files are distributed with
this package. The code also requires an parameter file, specifying run-time
parameters such as input/output directories, or specific code parameters. For
all example inputs a corresponding parameter file is distributed as well.

* Configuration and compilation

  ./src contains the source code and a Makefile. You might need to edit the
  Makefile to fit your system. Needed are suitable C and Fortran compilers,
  and the hdf5, lapack and gsl libraries. The Makefile in this package
  has been tested on a standard Linux installation (Debian Jessie), with
  the relevant libraries installed.

  $ cd src
  $ make

  To clean up the build directory:

  $ make clean

* Running

  To run the code, execute the kink_rwh executable, which needs one command
  line argument: the parameter file. Examples are distributed with this package,
  and are commented inline. They use the file extension '.par'.

  $ ./kink_rwh ./input/H2O_STO3G_c2v/H2O_STO3G_c2v.par

* Example data

  Example data for H2O, F2 and N2 can be found in data/ (also linked as
  src/input), in various basis sets.
